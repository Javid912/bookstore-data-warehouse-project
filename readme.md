## 1. Introduction
- What is the project content about? 
You will replicate, transform, and analyze data about book sales and orders.
- What is the problem we are solving with the project?
Data warehouses are the backbone of company analytics. This project will familiarize you with the design and architecture of data warehouses. If you are interested in a data analyst, analytics engineer, or data engineer role, this project will give you an introduction to how these roles interact with data in production.

## 2. Project Brief 
- How is the student going to work on the project?
You will collaborate with others delivering different parts of the same project.
- What is the major challenge of the project?
You will implement a data pipeline and a star schema data model, then use it for dashboards.


## 3. Learning Objective
List the components / frameworks which the student is going to use / learn. Example below:

- [x] concepts: data warehouses, Extract-Transform-Load, data modeling
- [x] BigQuery - massively parallel processing (MPP) data warehouse
- [x] airbyte - ETL tool
- [x] dbt - transformation tool
- [x] Metabase - BI tool

## 4. Extra Challenges for further developments
Add a few extra challenges for the more ambitious students. 
* Create additional fact table: `orders` that summarizes all order line items and adds shipping costs. Users can analyze sales and shipping.
* Create additional dimensional tables: `publishers` and `languages`. Users can analyze sales per publisher and languages.
* Create additional fact tables: `order_fulfillment`. Users can analyze orders by status.

## 5. Technical Setup
How can the student get started with the project? Example: 
1. Fork boilerplate repo
2. Set up the project with version control (e.g. Git)
3. Read the README.md file and have a look around the project
4. Get colors, fonts etc from the style-guide.md file
5. Set up your project/file architecture however you want
6. Start coding!
